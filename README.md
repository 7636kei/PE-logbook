# PE-logbook
This is my personal, Project Euler logbook (written in python). If you're also into Project Euler, consider not looking at solutions for problems you have not solved yourself if you want not to be spoiled (especially if you're also doing it with python).

This is also the first time I'm fooling around with GitHub.
