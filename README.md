# PE-logbook
This is my personal, Project Euler logbook (written in python). If you're also into Project Euler, consider not looking at solutions for problems you have not solved yourself if you want not to be spoiled (especially if you're also doing it with python).

In case the numbers in the filename look weird, it's because it's in hex. You'll also notice the earliest file is #9 rather than #1 because ... well, I only started bookkeeping just before I solved #9, so~ ü§ê

Also, this is a bookeeping of what I _first_ used to arrive to the solution. Expect not-optimised answers üòπ

This is also the first time I'm fooling around with GitHub.
